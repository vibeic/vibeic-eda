# Mirrors the awesome-open-ic enrich cron: flock so rounds never overlap, a fixed
# headless PATH/HOME, and gh OAuth resolved to GH_TOKEN (the vibeic org rejects
# long-lived fine-grained PATs; the gho_ OAuth token works headless). Then runs the
# gatekeeper tick, which re-seeds ledgers, decides merge/defer/clean per fork, writes
# the daily report, and regenerates the vibeic.ai monitor page.
#
# Scheduled by cron at 05:30 Asia/Taipei (UTC+8). Safe to run by hand.
